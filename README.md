# Employee-Management-System;

This Python-based GUI project is an advanced Employee Management System that offers comprehensive employee data management, real-time weather monitoring, and performance analysis. The application combines Tkinter, Requests, Matplotlib, and SQLite 3 to create a robust and user-friendly tool for organizations to efficiently manage their workforce and make data-driven decisions.

Features:

GUI: The project leverages Tkinter, a popular Python library for creating graphical user interfaces, to design an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The GUI allows easy navigation and interaction with various functionalities.

Employee Data Management: The Employee Management System provides a complete solution for managing employee records. Administrators can add, edit, view, and delete employee details, including personal information, contact details, department, position, and salary. The system ensures secure data handling and access control.

Live Location and Temperature: Employees can input their location, and the application uses the Requests library to fetch real-time weather data for that location. The GUI displays the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and other relevant weather information.

Real-Time Graph Plotting for Best Performing Employee with Highest Salary: The system includes an insightful feature that generates a real-time graph to analyze the performance of employees based on their salary. The Matplotlib library is utilized to plot a dynamic graph that showcases the correlation between salary and performance. This data visualization aids management in identifying the best-performing employees with the highest salaries.

Database Connectivity using SQLite 3: To ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, the application integrates SQLite 3 for database connectivity. All employee records, weather data, and performance analysis results are stored securely in a local SQLite database, facilitating data management and analysis.
